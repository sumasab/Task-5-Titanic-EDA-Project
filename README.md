# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Titanic dataset using Python libraries Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to extract insights and identify patterns related to passenger survival.

## What I did
- Loaded the Titanic dataset using seabornâ€™s built-in dataset.
- Explored dataset structure and summary statistics.
- Visualized key features using:
  - Count plots
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatterplots
  - Pairplots
  - Correlation heatmap
- Analyzed relationships between features and survival.
- Summarized observations and key findings.

## Files
- `Titanic_EDA_Task5.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with code and visuals.
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` - PDF report summarizing findings.

## Insights Summary
- More passengers did not survive than survived.
- Age distribution is mainly between 20-40 years.
- Passengers paying higher fares had better survival rates.
- Relationships between family size and survival were also explored.
- The heatmap showed correlations between numeric features.
